Coding Challenge DQ
========

Coding challenges can be categorized into a few kinds: 

  + Competitive Programming (Programming Contests): mostly algorithms & data structures (ADS/DSA).
  + Online Judge (gamification): mostly for online ranking/self-practice; for fun & reputation.
  + Interview/Recruitment: more oriented to job/software career, either employer tests or employee practicing.

### Fun CC ###

Besides, as a gamer you can think of "CC" as "crowd control" effects. 
As a Vietnamese, you can think of "CC" as "củ chuối", "4C" as "con ông cháu cha".

Vietnamese gamers: 

CCCC: cái con kủ quặc

4C: cười cái kột quờ

ATSM: ảo tưởng sức mạnh

BTB: bố thằng bệnh

CLGT?: Want To Fight?

Clgt?: Cũng là gà thôi?

clgt: chỉ là gió thoảng

lmgtfy: lờ mờ gờ tờ - ép i

LMGTFY: Let Me Google That - For You


### Execute CC ###

```
cd execute-cc

mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=vn.ducquoc.cc.execute.App

... (etc)

```
